# Based on the BoostBuilder,
# https://github.com/drbenmorgan/BoostBuilder

# - Boost(Cadfael) CMake Versioning File for External Projects
# This file is configured by Cadfael's Boost port for use with CMake's
# find_package in Config mode.
# It enables external projects to determine the version of Boost found.
# More importantly, it allows that command to automatically determine
# whether the found install is compatible with any VERSION that was
# supplied with find_package.
#
# As this file is configured by Boost(Cadfael) port system it SHOULD NOT
# BE EDITED
#

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Installed Version as set from CMake
#
set(PACKAGE_VERSION "@lib_VERSION@")

# Check whether the requested PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION is compatible with this
# installed version.
if("${PACKAGE_VERSION}" VERSION_LESS "${PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION}")
  set(PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE FALSE)
else()
  set(PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE TRUE)
  if ("${PACKAGE_VERSION}" VERSION_EQUAL "${PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION}")
    set(PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT TRUE)
  endif()
